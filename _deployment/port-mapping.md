title: Port Mapping
order: 700
---

You can define the ports on which your processes will listen in the manifest for your application.

## External Ports

External ports are open to the Internet. You define an external port using a port pair in the `ports:` section of your `docker-compose.yml`:

    ports:
      - 80:5000
      
This example configuration would listen to port `80` on an Internet-accessible load balancer and forward connections to port `5000` on the Process.

## Internal Ports

Internal ports are only accessible to other apps and services on the same Rack. You define an internal port using a single port in the `ports:` section of your `docker-compose.yml`:

    ports:
      - 5000
      
This example configuration would listen to port `5000` on an internal-only load balancer and forward connections to port `5000` on the Process.

If you want to make all of an application's ports internal, regardless of port definition, you can set the Internal app parameter.

    $ convox apps params set Internal=Yes

## TCP/UDP Protocols

By default, exposed ports are for the TCP protocol, but you can explicitly define the protocol to be used:

    ports:
      - 80:5000
      - 443:5000/tcp
      - 514:6000/udp

This example configuration would listen to ports `80` and `443` **on an Internet-accessible load balancer** and forward TCP connections to port `5000` on the Process, while it listens to port `514` **on the host** and forwards UDP packets to port `6000` on the Process. This difference between where the port is exposed is due to Elastic Load Balancers only supporting TCP connections. As a result, UDP ports are always internal-only. Additionally, since the host isn't using a random port for communicating with a load balancer, ensuring there are no port conflicts between processes is an exercise left up to the user.
