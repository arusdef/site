When you install a Rack from the CLI using `convox install`, it will not automatically appear on the Racks page in your [console.convox.com](https://console.convox.com) account. To include it in this list, click the <img src="/assets/images/docs/add-rack.png" alt="Add Rack" style="height: 1.5em;"> button in the upper right corner of the page and select "Add Existing." You'll then need to fill out and submit the form to finish adding the Rack to your Console account.
