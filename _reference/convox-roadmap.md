title: Convox Roadmap
---

The Convox Roadmap offers an up-to-date glimpse into our team's priorities and upcoming projects. To follow along, check out our public [Roadmap Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/XxvWeICx/roadmap). Most of the projects on the board link to GitHub Projects that track the relevant subtasks and issues.

We encourage you to take a look at our planned projects and share your thoughts on [GitHub](https://github.com/convox/rack/issues) or by submitting a support ticket from your [Console account](https://console.convox.com).
